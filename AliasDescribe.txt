Question 3:Configure your system in such a way that when a user type and executes a describe command from anywhere of the system it must list all the files and folders of the user's current directory.


Step 1:Open a terminal

Step 2:Create an alias named describe ,but it is defined for the user only

	alias describe="ls -la"
	
Step 4:Now lets make the previously created alias accessible globally by every user and every folder

	a)open bash.bashrc file 
	
	nano bash.bashrc 
	
	b)now go to the bottom of the file and add 
	
	alias describe="ls -la"
	
	Now anyone from anywhere can just type describe and can see all the files and folders of the current directory.
