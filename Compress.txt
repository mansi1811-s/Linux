Question 4:Users can put a compressed file at any path of the linux file system. The name of the file will be research and the extension will be of compression type, example for gzip type extension will be .gz.
You have to find the file and check the compression type and uncompress it.

Step 1:Create a file for writing shell script 

	nano search.sh 
	
	Then write the following lines .

	#!/bin/bash

	find_files=($(sudo find / -name "research.*" -type f 2>/dev/null))

	for find_file in "${find_files[@]}"; do
  		extension="${find_file##*.}"

  	case "$extension" in
    	gz)
      	 gzip -d "$find_file"
         echo "file uncompressed successfully"
      	;;
        xz)
         xz -d "$find_file"
         echo "file uncompressed successfully"
        ;;
        zip)
         unzip "$find_file"
         echo "file uncompressed successfully"
        ;;
        bz2)
         bzip2 -d "$find_file"
         echo "file uncompressed successfully"
        ;;
        *)
         echo "file not found: $find_file"
        ;;
   esac
 done
 
 Step 2:Save the file and make it executable with the following command
 
 	chmod +x search.sh

Step 3:Now run the script by using the following command

	sudo ./search.sh
	
	Now this script will search for any compressed file named "research" and uncompress it.
