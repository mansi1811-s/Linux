Question 5:Configure your system in such a way that any user of your system creates a file then there should not be permission to do any activity in that file.

	In order to do this we need to change the value of umask from default 002 to 777 by adding umask value in bash.bashrc file which is located in /etc folder
	
	a)open a terminal 
	
	b)go to /etc folder by using following command
	
		cd /etc
	
	c)now open bash.bashrc file by using any text editor
	
		nano bash.bashrc
		
	d)add umask value at the end of the file 
	
		umask 777
		
	e)save the file and exit
	
	
Now if we create a file then we cannot read ,write or execute that file .If we try to write in that file it will give "permission denied"
