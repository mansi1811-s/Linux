Question 6:Create a service with the name showtime , after starting the service, every minute it should print the current time in a file in the user home directory.


Ex:-
sudo service showtime start   -> It should start writing in file.
sudo service showtime stop   -> It should stop writing in file.
sudo service showtime status -> It should show status.


Step 1:open terminal and create a script file "showtime.sh"
	
	Under showtime.sh write the following lines
	
	#!/bin/bash

	while true; do
        	date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" >> "home/sigmoid/showtime.log"
        sleep 60
	done

Step 2:Make the script "showtime.sh" executable by using the following command
	
	chmod +x showtime.sh
	
Step 3:Create the service called showtime.service in /etc/systemd/system/showtime.sh

	[Unit]
	Description=Showtime Service
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	Type=simple
	User=sigmoid
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/showtime.sh
	Restart=always

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
	
	Save it and close
	
Step 4:To reload the entire systemd unit files use the following command

	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	
Step 5:Start the showtime service by using the following command

	sudo systemctl start showtime.service
			  OR
	sudo service showtime start
	
Step 6:To know the status of the service use the following command

	sudo systemctl status showtime.sh
			  OR
	sudo service showtime status
	
Step 7:We can check whether our service is working properly by checking our log file

	cat showtime.log
	
	If there are entries of day,date and time then it means our service is working successfully 
	
Step 8:To stop the service use one of the following command

	sudo systemctl stop showtime.service
		  OR
	sudo service showtime stop
